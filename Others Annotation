@Bean vs @Component
@Bean: 
1. Method Level Annotation
2. Need to manually create the bean

@Component
1. Class Level Annotation
2. Implicitly create the bean. 

@Configuration
Using @Configuration over a class means that, this class is a configuration 
file which will be used by Spring Container to set up the project. 
It also might declare one or more @Bean methods which ask Spring to process at Runtime.

@Transactional
The built in methods of JpaRepostiory are Transactional By default.
But when we add custom methods in JpaRepository then we have to add @Transactional
in the service. [Built in methods like -> findAll(), findById(), save(), deleteById() etc.]
